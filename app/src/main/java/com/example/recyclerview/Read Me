first we put recyclerview in xml
then
we make a resource file called recycler_veiw_item.xml
then
in recycler view we "tools:listitem="@layout/recycler_view_item"" and then we create an adapter
adapter is like a bridge btw both

Adapter
    According to Lectures
    ist we created a data class of ExampleItems
    then we create a adapter file
    in this fist we  bind both class (ExampleItem &  RecyclerView.Adapter)
    and we created an inner class class called ViewHolder


    And this showing an error in this  class (ExampleItem &  RecyclerView.Adapter)
    we then override all the members

    And in view ExampleViewHolder class we connect widget of our recycler_view_item.xml

    onCreateViewHolder
    it used to find what are item list are used in this code you haven't to remember code

    onBindViewHolder
    it is used to bind the item

    getItemCount
    this is used to set the max the lenght of recyclerView

     android:clickable="true"
        android:focusable="true"    TODO this is used to add ripple effect
        android:foreground="?android:attr/selectableItemBackground"

        And at the we setOnClickListener to jump to Activity code
        and this was defined in Adapter.ExampleItem
